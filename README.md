# FinRep

A financial analytics app that leverages Singlestore, OpenAI, LLAMA-2, and Huggingface to create a multi-functional platform. 

We have a 4 fold approach to this platform:

1. LLM (PDF) + Chat system
2. News aggregator ([Tickertape](https://www.tickertape.in/)) - News/Twitter/Reddit
3. Fundamental Analysis
4. Future development (Time Series forecasting with sentiment analysis from news aggregator and fundamental data)

The app is designed to allow users to upload their financial report to extract fundamental data, such as revenue and expenses. Additionally, it can analyse financial statements and performance metrics to provide users with insights into their financial health. 

The app also includes a natural language processing (NLP) interface, allowing users to ask questions and receive answers in plain language. Finally, the app includes a machine learning component that can predict future financial performance based on historical data. (Time Series Analytics)
